# Team-Gen
## Description

*Our task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team using the Inquirer package, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so we'll also write a unit test for every part of our code and ensure that it passes each test.


## Tools Used/install
